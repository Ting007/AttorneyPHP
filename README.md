# AttorneyPHP 
This project is aiming at implementing the process of separating two sides in a large legal office. The legal office adopts Chinese Wall security policy trying to establish standards of professional conduct for lawyers and maintain the secure privacy of company documents and data. <br />
In this project, we build up a simplified lawyer office system and enforce a security model based on Chinese Wall policy. This policy is used in conflict of interests situations. In our system, we control the access of lawyers to documents and their communications through this system. Any violation of the policy will be informed to IPO. Also, when IPO create new case and assign lawyers, the policy is enforced. <br />
